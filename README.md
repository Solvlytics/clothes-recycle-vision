# Project Introduction

This project develops a deep learning-based pipeline for the classification and captioning of used clothing items based on contamination detection. Using state-of-the-art object detection (YOLOv8) and image captioning (BLIP) models, the system identifies clothing types and contamination to categorize items into reuse, recycle, or dispose classes. The ultimate goal is to enhance resource recycling efficiency and reduce textile waste by automating clothing assessment and description generation.
